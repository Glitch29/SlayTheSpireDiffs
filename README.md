# SlayTheSpireDiffs
Project for sharing diffs with MegaCrit

This is a collection of snippets from a decompiled version of SlayTheSpire, along with fixes to that code. The diffs are being PM'd to one of the StS developers.

I am making these fixes as a bit of a community service for a game that I like. It's also nice to get a bit of coding practice.
